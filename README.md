TIF (Testing is fun): Unit tests for the simulation software NetLogo
====================================================================

## Description

TIF (tif.nls) is a library for the simulation software NetLogo [[1](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)] helping to write [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing). Compared to the extension *Test* of NetLogo, this module is written in NetLogo and its usage is fun. It is largely inspired from the [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/test_that) package [2] for the statistical software R.
